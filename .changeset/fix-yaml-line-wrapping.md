Fix YAML frontmatter line wrapping that broke skill installation. The `yaml` library's default 80-character line width was folding long strings (like `description`) across multiple lines, which broke frontmatter parsers expecting single-line values. Disabled line wrapping with `lineWidth: 0` for all YAML serialization (frontmatter, rule files, and test files).
