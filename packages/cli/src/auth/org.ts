 * server's coming identity cleanup:
 *
 * - `id` — the canonical, stable, platform-agnostic Taskless org id and the
 *   only subject the CLI acts on. A UUID string, so kept as the generated
 *   `string` (the `string | number` tolerance lives on the legacy JWT-claim
 *   path in `decodeOrgId`, where a numeric id can still appear).
 * - `githubOrgId` — GitHub's numeric org id, a convenience only. The server is
 *   renaming the legacy `orgId` to this; read `githubOrgId ?? orgId` so either
 *   spelling resolves during the transition.
 * - `installationId` is intentionally dropped — the CLI never uses it and it
 *   should not be sent to us.
 *
 * `url` is the canonical OWNER url (e.g. `https://github.com/acme`) matched
 * against the repo's remotes.
