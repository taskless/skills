/**
 * One-line trailer printed by `taskless init` (and the wizard) after a
 * successful install. Lives here so the install paths share the same
 * wording with the onboard subcommand they point at.
 *
 * Branches on whether any installed target received the `tskl` slash
 * command. Tools that get commands (Claude Code, Cursor) also get the
 * Taskless skill, so the with-commands trailer mentions both AI-tool
 * paths; tools without commands (OpenCode, Codex, `.agents` fallback)
 * still get the skill, so the no-commands trailer points at the skill.
 * Both trailers also mention `taskless onboard` as the bare CLI fallback.
