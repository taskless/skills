/**
 * Stack breadcrumb — pure, zero-dependency logic.
 *
 * A portable port of the `@taskless/stack-breadcrumb` package's core: it derives
 * a stacked-PR forest from `base`/`head` relationships, renders a breadcrumb
 * region, and plans the minimal body edits to keep every PR in a stack pointing
 * at its siblings. There is NO GitHub I/O here — the workflow supplies the PR
 * list (via `actions/github-script`'s octokit) and a `writeBody` callback, so
 * this file needs no npm install, no build step, and stays unit-testable with
 * `node --test`.
 *
 * The two-stage workflow keeps reconciliation serialized per stack root:
 *   stage 1 (dispatch)  — on PR shape events, resolve the affected root(s) and
 *                         fire a `repository_dispatch`.
 *   stage 2 (reconcile) — on that dispatch, render and propagate the breadcrumb.

// The tree is ADDITIVE: once a PR joins a stack it stays in the breadcrumb, even
// after it merges. Two facts feed the shape:
//
//   1. LIVE parent — the PR whose head branch is this PR's base. This reflects
//      the current GitHub graph and is authoritative: it is not user-editable.
//   2. RECORDED parent — the marker encodes topology as `member:parent`
//      (`pr=82,83:82,84:83`). This is durable: it does not change when a branch
//      is deleted or a PR is retargeted.
//
// The LIVE parent wins. The RECORDED parent is only a fallback for a SEVERED
// edge: when a parent merges, GitHub deletes its branch and retargets the child
// onto the default branch (child.base becomes `main`), so `findRoot` would call
// the child its own root and the merged parent would vanish. In that one case —
// and only when the recorded parent names a KNOWN merged/closed ancestor — the
// recorded link is used, so `buildTree` climbs back to the true root and keeps
// the merged ancestor in the tree. Because PR bodies are user-editable, this
// containment (recorded never overrides a live edge, never attaches a PR under
// an open one) stops a crafted marker from re-parenting an unrelated PR. The
// marker is written while the edges are still live, so the topology is captured
// BEFORE any retarget can sever it.
//
// A legacy flat marker (`pr=82,83,84`) records no parents, so such a stack
// derives purely from the live graph — identical to the pre-topology behavior —
// and self-migrates to the recorded form on its next reconcile.
