# Skill: Taskless

## Purpose

Defines the single consolidated `taskless` skill that replaced the per-task skills (`taskless-check`, `taskless-create-rule`, `taskless-create-rule-anonymous`, `taskless-improve-rule`, `taskless-improve-rule-anonymous`, `taskless-delete-rule`, `taskless-info`, `taskless-login`, `taskless-logout`, `taskless-ci`) in v0.7. The skill body is a small router whose canonical recipes live behind `npx @taskless/cli help <topic>`, fetched on demand by the agent rather than always loaded.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Single consolidated taskless skill replaces per-task skills

The skills bundle SHALL contain exactly one skill named `taskless`. This skill SHALL replace the per-task skills `taskless-check`, `taskless-create-rule`, `taskless-create-rule-anonymous`, `taskless-improve-rule`, `taskless-improve-rule-anonymous`, `taskless-delete-rule`, `taskless-info`, `taskless-login`, `taskless-logout`, and `taskless-ci`. The skill SHALL be installed into every detected tool location (Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor, etc.) per the existing install plumbing.

#### Scenario: Bundle contains exactly one skill

- **WHEN** the CLI bundle is built
- **THEN** `import.meta.glob("../../../../skills/**/SKILL.md")` SHALL match exactly one file at `skills/taskless/SKILL.md`

#### Scenario: Skill catalog has one entry

- **WHEN** `getMandatorySkillNames()` is called
- **THEN** it SHALL return `["taskless"]`
- **AND** `getOptionalSkillNames()` SHALL return `[]`

#### Scenario: Old skill directories are removed

- **WHEN** the v0.7.0 release is built
- **THEN** none of the directories `skills/taskless-check`, `skills/taskless-ci`, `skills/taskless-create-rule`, `skills/taskless-create-rule-anonymous`, `skills/taskless-delete-rule`, `skills/taskless-improve-rule`, `skills/taskless-improve-rule-anonymous`, `skills/taskless-info`, `skills/taskless-login`, or `skills/taskless-logout` SHALL exist in the repository

### Requirement: Skill description anchors triggers on Taskless-specific phrases

The consolidated skill's `description` frontmatter field SHALL anchor triggers on:

1. An explicit reference to "Taskless" in the user's message, OR
2. A reference to the `.taskless/` directory or files within it (rules, rule-tests, rule-metadata), OR
3. A request to add/write/create a rule for code, including requests that name a specific lint/format/static-analysis tool (for example eslint, ruff, biome, stylelint, ast-grep). Naming such a tool SHALL engage the skill's routing flow rather than suppress it; the skill routes the request toward the appropriate authoring destination via `npx @taskless/cli help route`.

The description SHALL NOT instruct the agent to suppress or quiet itself merely because a lint/format/static-analysis tool is named, and SHALL NOT contain a blanket "do NOT trigger on generic linting" instruction.

#### Scenario: Description includes anchored trigger phrases

- **WHEN** the skill `description` field is read
- **THEN** it SHALL include trigger phrases such as "create/add/write a taskless rule", "improve/fix/iterate on this taskless rule", "run taskless", "taskless login", "add taskless to CI"
- **AND** SHALL include a rule-authoring clause covering "add/write/create a rule" for code

#### Scenario: Naming a linter engages routing rather than suppressing

- **WHEN** the user asks to add/write/create a rule and names a specific lint/format/static-analysis tool (for example "write an eslint rule for X")
- **THEN** the skill SHALL trigger and route the request via `npx @taskless/cli help route`
- **AND** SHALL NOT quiet itself to a one-line offer on the basis of the named tool

#### Scenario: Description omits suppression and the prior blanket carve-out

- **WHEN** the skill `description` field is read
- **THEN** it SHALL NOT contain wording instructing the agent to suppress on a named lint/format/static-analysis tool
- **AND** it SHALL NOT contain wording instructing the agent to never trigger on generic ESLint/linting requests

#### Scenario: Description is at most 1024 characters

- **WHEN** the skill `description` field length is measured
- **THEN** it SHALL be at most 1024 characters (Agent Skills spec limit)

### Requirement: Skill body is a router, not an inline recipe

The consolidated skill body SHALL NOT contain step-by-step instructions for any individual Taskless task. The body SHALL be a router that:

1. States explicitly that the agent does NOT have the steps for any Taskless action in its context.
2. Instructs the agent to fetch the canonical recipe via `npx @taskless/cli help <topic>` before proceeding.
3. Provides a topic disambiguation table mapping user intents to topic names. The table SHALL include a row for the new `onboard` topic.
4. Includes a `## --anonymous` section explaining the global flag's behavior.
5. Includes a first-step `.taskless/` presence check with graceful failure ("ask the user to confirm they meant Taskless").
6. Includes a `## Quiet suggestion` (or equivalently named) section governing the proactive trigger introduced via the description's named-tool clause. This section SHALL specify that:
   - When the skill triggers because the user wants to add a rule and has not named a specific tool, the agent SHALL surface a single-line offer to capture the rule via Taskless rather than launching into a full recipe (e.g., "I can capture this as a Taskless rule if you want — say so, or I'll proceed with X").
   - If the user declines or ignores the offer, the agent SHALL proceed with whatever it would have done without the skill.
   - If the user declines, the agent SHALL NOT re-offer Taskless in the same conversation. No persistent decline state SHALL be written to disk.
   - If the user accepts, the skill router SHALL proceed normally to fetch `npx @taskless/cli help rule create`.

The body SHALL be no more than 80 lines of markdown to keep the always-loaded surface small. (The previous 60-line cap is relaxed to accommodate the new quiet-suggestion section and the `onboard` row.)

#### Scenario: Skill body warns against improvising

- **WHEN** the skill body is read by an agent
- **THEN** it SHALL contain explicit framing such as "You do NOT have the steps... do not improvise from prior knowledge"

#### Scenario: Skill body lists available topics including onboard

- **WHEN** the skill body is read by an agent
- **THEN** it SHALL include a table or list mapping user intents to the corresponding `tskl help <topic>` invocations
- **AND** the table SHALL include a row for `onboard` mapped to `npx @taskless/cli help onboard` (or equivalent invocation of the onboard topic)

#### Scenario: Skill body checks for .taskless directory

- **WHEN** the skill is invoked
- **THEN** the body's first step SHALL instruct the agent to check whether `.taskless/` exists in the working directory
- **AND** to ask the user to confirm Taskless is what they meant if the directory is absent

#### Scenario: Skill body specifies quiet suggestion behavior

- **WHEN** the skill is triggered by the unspecified-tool clause from the description
- **THEN** the body's quiet-suggestion section SHALL instruct the agent to surface a single-line offer rather than a full recipe
- **AND** SHALL instruct the agent NOT to re-offer in the same conversation if declined
- **AND** SHALL specify that no persistent decline state is written

#### Scenario: Skill body specifies in-conversation decline is sticky

- **WHEN** the user has declined a quiet-suggestion offer once in the current conversation
- **THEN** the body SHALL instruct the agent not to surface the offer again in the same conversation

#### Scenario: Skill body length cap

- **WHEN** the skill body is measured
- **THEN** it SHALL be no more than 80 lines of markdown

### Requirement: Skill maps to a single tskl command

The consolidated skill's frontmatter SHALL include `metadata.commandName: tskl` so that command-installation plumbing maps the skill to the new single command file at `commands/tskl/tskl.md`. The command file SHALL be a thin doorway that accepts a free-form `$ARGUMENTS` ask, infers a topic if possible, and otherwise asks the user what they want to do.

#### Scenario: Frontmatter declares the command mapping

- **WHEN** the skill frontmatter is parsed
- **THEN** `metadata.commandName` SHALL equal `tskl`

#### Scenario: Old command files are removed

- **WHEN** the v0.7.0 release is built
- **THEN** none of `commands/tskl/check.md`, `commands/tskl/improve.md`, `commands/tskl/info.md`, `commands/tskl/login.md`, `commands/tskl/logout.md`, or `commands/tskl/rule.md` SHALL exist in the repository
- **AND** exactly one file `commands/tskl/tskl.md` SHALL exist

#### Scenario: Slash command accepts free-form arguments

- **WHEN** a user invokes `/tskl` with arguments (e.g. `/tskl create a rule for no console.log`)
- **THEN** the command body SHALL instruct the agent to infer the topic from `$ARGUMENTS`, fetch the recipe via `npx @taskless/cli help <topic>`, and proceed

#### Scenario: Slash command without arguments asks the user

- **WHEN** a user invokes `/tskl` with no arguments
- **THEN** the command body SHALL instruct the agent to ask the user what they want to do with Taskless before proceeding

### Requirement: Skill routes authoring requests through the routing front door

The skill body SHALL route rule-authoring requests through `npx @taskless/cli help route`
as the authoring front door, rather than fetching `rule create` directly. The
skill SHALL add no linter knowledge of its own and SHALL remain a thin router that
defers all authoring judgment to the fetched recipes.

#### Scenario: Authoring requests are routed via route

- **WHEN** the user asks to author a rule (with or without naming a tool)
- **THEN** the skill body SHALL direct the agent to fetch `npx @taskless/cli help route`
  before any login-gated path
- **AND** SHALL NOT embed linter-specific rule knowledge in the skill body

#### Scenario: Local-first before login

- **WHEN** the routing recipe has not yet demonstrated that a rule cannot be built
  locally
- **THEN** the skill SHALL NOT direct the agent toward a login-gated authoring
  path
