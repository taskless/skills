# CLI Rules

## Purpose

Defines the `rules` subcommand group for the Taskless CLI, including `create`, `improve`, `delete`, and `verify` subcommands for managing ast-grep rules. Also documents the server-side API contract for rule generation endpoints.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Rules subcommand group exists

The CLI SHALL expose the rule operations under the `rule` (singular) subcommand group. The user-facing surface SHALL be `taskless rule create`, `taskless rule improve`, `taskless rule delete`, `taskless rule verify`, and `taskless rule meta`. The internal source filename (`packages/cli/src/commands/rules.ts`) MAY remain plural — only the user-visible subcommand name changes.

The previous plural form `taskless rules <subcommand>` SHALL NOT work in v0.7.0 — there is no compatibility alias.

#### Scenario: Singular subcommand registers correctly

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless rule create --from req.json`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL invoke the rule-create handler

#### Scenario: Plural subcommand is no longer recognized

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless rules create --from req.json`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL exit with an error indicating the subcommand is unknown
- **AND** the error message SHOULD suggest `taskless rule create`

### Requirement: Rules create reads request from stdin

The `taskless rule create` command SHALL accept a `--from <file>` flag specifying a JSON file containing the rule request. (Note: previously named `rules create`; renamed to singular.)

#### Scenario: rule create with --from file

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless rule create --from .taskless/.tmp-rule-request.json --json`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL read the JSON file and submit it to the API

### Requirement: Rules create resolves identity from JWT and git remote

`taskless rule create` resolves user identity from the stored JWT and the git remote per the existing identity resolution requirements. (Renamed to singular.)

### Requirement: Rules create requires authentication

`taskless rule create` SHALL require authentication unless the new `--anonymous` flag is set. When `--anonymous` is set, the command SHALL invoke the local-only flow (see "Rule create supports anonymous local-only flow" below) instead of submitting to the API. (Renamed to singular; new anonymous branch.)

#### Scenario: rule create without --anonymous requires auth

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless rule create --from req.json` without being logged in
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL exit with code 1 and an `AUTH_REQUIRED` error

#### Scenario: rule create --anonymous skips auth

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless rule create --from req.json --anonymous` without being logged in
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL invoke the local-only flow without checking auth

### Requirement: Rules create submits to API and polls for results

`taskless rule create` (without `--anonymous`) submits to the API and polls per the existing requirement. (Renamed to singular.)

### Requirement: Rules create uses a network interface with stub

The API calls for rule generation (`POST /cli/api/request` and `GET /cli/api/request/:requestId`) SHALL be defined as a TypeScript interface. The initial implementation SHALL use a stub that returns an error indicating the API is not yet available. This allows the CLI UX to be built and tested independently of the API.

#### Scenario: Stub implementation returns an error

- **WHEN** `rule create` is run against the stub network layer
- **THEN** the stub SHALL return an error indicating rule generation is not yet available

#### Scenario: Interface is swappable

- **WHEN** the real API becomes available
- **THEN** the stub SHALL be replaceable with a real HTTP implementation without changing the command logic

### Requirement: Rules create writes rule files to disk

`taskless rule create` SHALL write the generated rule file to `.taskless/rules/<id>.yml` regardless of whether `--anonymous` was set. The agent invoking the command SHALL NOT be expected to write rule files itself. (Renamed to singular; this strengthens the existing requirement to apply to both branches.)

#### Scenario: Both branches write rule files

- **WHEN** `taskless rule create` succeeds (with or without `--anonymous`)
- **THEN** `.taskless/rules/<id>.yml` SHALL exist on disk

### Requirement: Rules create writes test files to disk

`taskless rule create` SHALL write generated test files to `.taskless/rule-tests/<id>.yml` regardless of whether `--anonymous` was set. (Renamed; strengthened.)

### Requirement: Rules create outputs results

`taskless rule create` outputs results per the existing requirement. (Renamed to singular.) Output SHALL be human-readable by default; `--json` produces machine-readable output. On failure with `--json` set, the output SHALL be the standardized error envelope `{ ok: false, code: "<CODE>", message: "<...>" }` per the `cli` capability requirements.

### Requirement: Rules create shows progress during polling

`taskless rule create` shows progress per the existing requirement when polling the API (the `--anonymous` branch does not poll an API and SHOULD show progress for the local agent-driven steps if applicable). (Renamed to singular.)

### Requirement: Rules improve reads request from file

`taskless rule improve` SHALL accept a `--from <file>` flag specifying a JSON file containing the iterate request. (Renamed to singular.)

### Requirement: Rules improve requires authentication

`taskless rule improve` SHALL require authentication unless `--anonymous` is set. (Renamed; new anonymous branch.)

### Requirement: Rules improve submits to iterate API and polls for results

`taskless rule improve` (without `--anonymous`) submits and polls per the existing requirement. (Renamed.)

### Requirement: Rules improve writes updated files to disk

`taskless rule improve` SHALL write updated rule files to disk in both branches. (Renamed; strengthened.)

### Requirement: Rules improve outputs results

`taskless rule improve` outputs results per the existing requirement. (Renamed.) Failure output with `--json` SHALL use the standardized error envelope.

### Requirement: Rules improve has a help entry

`taskless help rule improve` SHALL return the recipe per `cli-help` requirements. (Renamed; the help filename becomes `rule-improve.txt` with an optional `rule-improve.anonymous.txt` variant.)

### Requirement: Rules delete removes rule and test files

`taskless rule delete <id>` SHALL remove the corresponding rule file and any test files. (Renamed.) Accepts `--anonymous` as a no-op.

### Requirement: Rules delete does not require authentication

`taskless rule delete` does not require authentication per the existing requirement. (Renamed.)

### Requirement: Rules delete accepts the id argument

`taskless rule delete <id>` accepts the rule ID as a positional argument per the existing requirement. (Renamed.)

### Requirement: Codegen script fetches official ast-grep rule schema

A codegen script (`packages/cli/scripts/fetch-ast-grep-schema.ts`) SHALL fetch the official ast-grep rule JSON Schema from GitHub and store it as a generated artifact committed to git. The schema version SHALL be pinned to the `@ast-grep/cli` version specified in `packages/cli/package.json`. The script is run manually via `pnpm generate:ast-grep-schema` when the ast-grep version is bumped.

#### Scenario: Codegen fetches schema from GitHub

- **WHEN** the codegen script is executed
- **THEN** it SHALL fetch `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ast-grep/ast-grep/{VERSION}/schemas/rule.json` where `{VERSION}` is the `@ast-grep/cli` version from `packages/cli/package.json`
- **AND** write the result to `packages/cli/src/generated/ast-grep-rule-schema.json`

#### Scenario: Generated schema includes metadata comment

- **WHEN** the schema file is generated
- **THEN** it SHALL include a `$comment` field with the generation timestamp, ast-grep version, and source URL

#### Scenario: Generated schema is committed to git

- **WHEN** the codegen script completes
- **THEN** the generated file SHALL be committed to the repository alongside other generated artifacts in `packages/cli/src/generated/`

### Requirement: Schema version is pinned to ast-grep dependency

The codegen script SHALL extract the ast-grep version from `packages/cli/package.json` dependencies. The version extraction SHALL handle semver range prefixes (e.g., `^0.41.0` resolves to `0.41.0`).

#### Scenario: Version extracted from package.json

- **WHEN** `packages/cli/package.json` has `"@ast-grep/cli": "^0.41.0"` in dependencies
- **THEN** the codegen script SHALL fetch the schema for version `0.41.0`

#### Scenario: Codegen fails gracefully on network error

- **WHEN** the GitHub fetch fails (network error, 404, etc.)
- **THEN** the codegen script SHALL exit with a non-zero code and a descriptive error message
- **AND** SHALL NOT overwrite an existing generated schema file

### Requirement: Generated schema is importable at build time

The generated JSON Schema file SHALL be importable by the CLI bundle via Vite. The import SHALL make the full JSON Schema object available at runtime without filesystem reads or network fetches.

#### Scenario: Schema imported in verify command

- **WHEN** the `rule verify` command needs the ast-grep schema
- **THEN** it SHALL import the schema from `../generated/ast-grep-rule-schema.json`
- **AND** the schema object SHALL be available synchronously at runtime

### Requirement: Verify subcommand validates rules against ast-grep schema

`taskless rule verify` SHALL validate rules against the ast-grep schema per the existing requirement. (Renamed from `rules verify` to `rule verify`.) Accepts `--anonymous` as a no-op.

### Requirement: Verify performs three layers of validation

`taskless rule verify` performs the three layers of validation per the existing requirement. (Renamed.)

### Requirement: Verify supports JSON output

`taskless rule verify --json` outputs results in the documented JSON shape. On failure, the standardized error envelope is used. (Renamed.)

### Requirement: Verify schema mode dumps combined schema for agent consumption

The `taskless rule verify --schema` mode is REMOVED in v0.7.0 — schemas are now embedded in `tskl help rule create` recipe output via `zod-to-json-schema`. (Renamed and superseded.)

#### Scenario: --schema flag is no longer accepted

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless rule verify --schema`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL exit with an error indicating the flag is unknown

### Requirement: Verify respects global flags

`taskless rule verify` respects global flags including `--dir` per the existing requirement. (Renamed.) Also accepts the new `--anonymous` flag as a no-op.

### Requirement: Rule create supports anonymous local-only flow

When `taskless rule create --anonymous` is invoked, the CLI SHALL execute the local-only rule-creation flow (previously implemented as the `taskless-create-rule-anonymous` skill body). The flow SHALL:

1. NOT submit any request to the Taskless API
2. Generate the ast-grep rule using local logic (Claude SDK, agent-driven generation, or whatever the migrated implementation prefers — see design.md)
3. Write the rule file to `.taskless/rules/<id>.yml`
4. Write any generated test files to `.taskless/rule-tests/<id>.yml`
5. NOT write a metadata sidecar (the API-backed branch does)
6. Return the same output format as the API-backed branch (paths to created files)

#### Scenario: rule create --anonymous skips API

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless rule create --from req.json --anonymous`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL NOT make any HTTP request to the Taskless API
- **AND** SHALL produce a rule file under `.taskless/rules/`

#### Scenario: rule create --anonymous produces no metadata sidecar

- **WHEN** `taskless rule create --anonymous` succeeds
- **THEN** no file under `.taskless/rule-metadata/` SHALL be written for the new rule

### Requirement: Rule improve supports anonymous local-only flow

When `taskless rule improve --anonymous` is invoked, the CLI SHALL execute the local-only rule-improvement flow (previously implemented as the `taskless-improve-rule-anonymous` skill body). The flow SHALL:

1. NOT submit any request to the Taskless API iterate endpoint
2. Update the rule file in place using local logic
3. Support the verify feedback loop by exposing the `rule verify` primitive that the agent invokes between edits
4. Return the same output format as the API-backed branch

#### Scenario: rule improve --anonymous skips API

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless rule improve --from iterate.json --anonymous`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL NOT make any HTTP request to the Taskless API
- **AND** SHALL update the target rule file
