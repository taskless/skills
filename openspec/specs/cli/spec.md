# CLI

## Purpose

TBD — Defines the structure and build requirements for the `@taskless/cli` package.

## Requirements

### Requirement: CLI package exists at packages/cli

The `@taskless/cli` package SHALL exist at `packages/cli/` with its own `package.json` declaring the package name `@taskless/cli`.

#### Scenario: Package is discoverable by pnpm workspace

- **WHEN** `pnpm-workspace.yaml` declares `packages/*`
- **THEN** pnpm SHALL resolve `@taskless/cli` as a workspace package at `packages/cli/`

### Requirement: CLI has a bin entry point

The package SHALL declare a `bin` field in `package.json` pointing to the built output. The built file SHALL include a Node.js shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env node`).

#### Scenario: CLI is executable via npx

- **WHEN** a user runs `npx @taskless/cli`
- **THEN** Node.js SHALL execute the bin entry point

#### Scenario: CLI is executable via pnpm dlx

- **WHEN** a user runs `pnpm dlx @taskless/cli`
- **THEN** Node.js SHALL execute the bin entry point

### Requirement: CLI builds with Vite

The CLI SHALL use Vite in library mode to produce a single bundled ESM output file. The build configuration SHALL live in `packages/cli/vite.config.ts`. The Vite build SHALL embed skills from `skills/`, commands from `commands/taskless/`, and help text files from `packages/cli/src/help/` via `import.meta.glob` with raw file imports. The build SHALL assert that every embedded skill's `metadata.version` matches the CLI's `package.json` version, failing with an error if any mismatch is detected.

#### Scenario: Build produces executable output

- **WHEN** `pnpm build` is run in `packages/cli/`
- **THEN** Vite SHALL produce a single file in `dist/` that is a valid Node.js ESM module with a shebang

#### Scenario: Build embeds skills from skills directory

- **WHEN** `pnpm build` is run in `packages/cli/`
- **THEN** every `SKILL.md` file under `skills/` at the repo root SHALL be embedded in the output bundle

#### Scenario: Build embeds commands from commands directory

- **WHEN** `pnpm build` is run in `packages/cli/`
- **THEN** every `.md` file under `commands/taskless/` at the repo root SHALL be embedded in the output bundle

#### Scenario: Build embeds help text files

- **WHEN** `pnpm build` is run in `packages/cli/`
- **THEN** every `.txt` file under `packages/cli/src/help/` SHALL be embedded in the output bundle

#### Scenario: Build fails on version mismatch

- **WHEN** any embedded SKILL.md has a `metadata.version` that differs from `packages/cli/package.json` version
- **THEN** the Vite build SHALL fail with an error identifying the mismatched skill(s)

### Requirement: CLI TypeScript config extends base

The CLI SHALL have a `packages/cli/tsconfig.json` that extends `../../tsconfig.base.json`. It SHALL add any CLI-specific compiler options without duplicating base settings.

#### Scenario: Type checking passes independently

- **WHEN** `pnpm typecheck` is run in `packages/cli/`
- **THEN** `tsc` SHALL pass with no errors using the extended config

### Requirement: CLI stub entry point

The CLI entry point SHALL use citty to define a main command with subcommand support and a global `-d` (alias `--dir`) argument that sets the working directory, a global `--json` boolean argument for machine-readable output, and a global `--schema` boolean argument for printing JSON Schema definitions. When invoked with no arguments, the CLI SHALL display help text listing available subcommands. The CLI SHALL externalize Node.js built-in modules and bundle all other dependencies. The `check` subcommand, the `auth` subcommand group, the `rules` subcommand group, and the `help` subcommand SHALL be registered alongside existing subcommands. The `update-engine` subcommand SHALL NOT be registered.

#### Scenario: Running the CLI with no arguments shows help

- **WHEN** the CLI is executed with no arguments
- **THEN** it SHALL print help text to stdout listing available subcommands including `help`
- **AND** the help text SHALL NOT list `update-engine`

#### Scenario: Running the CLI with an unknown subcommand shows help

- **WHEN** the CLI is executed with an unrecognized subcommand
- **THEN** it SHALL print help text to stdout

#### Scenario: Update-engine subcommand is not registered

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless update-engine`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL print help text (unrecognized subcommand)

#### Scenario: Init subcommand remains unchanged

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless init`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL route to the init subcommand handler
- **AND** the init handler SHALL NOT perform scaffold updates

#### Scenario: Update alias is removed

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless update`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL NOT route to the init handler
- **AND** SHALL show help text (unrecognized subcommand)

#### Scenario: Global -d flag is accepted

- **WHEN** the CLI is executed with `-d /some/path` or `--dir /some/path`
- **THEN** the specified path SHALL be available to all subcommands as the resolved working directory

#### Scenario: Working directory defaults to process.cwd()

- **WHEN** the CLI is executed without the `-d` flag
- **THEN** the working directory SHALL default to `process.cwd()`

#### Scenario: Global --json flag is accepted

- **WHEN** the CLI is executed with `--json`
- **THEN** the flag SHALL be available to all subcommands as `args.json`

#### Scenario: --json defaults to false

- **WHEN** a user runs a subcommand without `--json`
- **THEN** `args.json` SHALL be `false`

#### Scenario: Global --schema flag is accepted

- **WHEN** the CLI is executed with `--schema`
- **THEN** the flag SHALL be available to all subcommands as `args.schema`

#### Scenario: --schema defaults to false

- **WHEN** a user runs a subcommand without `--schema`
- **THEN** `args.schema` SHALL be `false`

#### Scenario: --schema is ignored by commands without --json support

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless auth login --schema`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL ignore the `--schema` flag and proceed normally

#### Scenario: Check subcommand is registered

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless check`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL route to the check subcommand handler

#### Scenario: Auth subcommand group is registered

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless auth`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL route to the auth subcommand group

#### Scenario: Rules subcommand group is registered

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless rules`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL route to the rules subcommand group

#### Scenario: Help subcommand is registered

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless help`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL route to the help subcommand handler

### Requirement: CLI manages .taskless/.gitignore

The CLI SHALL proactively create and maintain a `.taskless/.gitignore` file that ignores local-only files. The gitignore SHALL contain entries for `.env.local.json` and `sgconfig.yml`. Any CLI command that writes to `.taskless/` SHALL ensure the `.gitignore` file exists with these entries before writing.

#### Scenario: .gitignore is created when .taskless/ is first written to

- **WHEN** the CLI creates any file in `.taskless/` (e.g., during `auth login`, `rules create`, or `check`)
- **AND** `.taskless/.gitignore` does not exist
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL create `.taskless/.gitignore` containing `.env.local.json` and `sgconfig.yml`

#### Scenario: Existing .gitignore is preserved

- **WHEN** `.taskless/.gitignore` already exists with additional user entries
- **AND** the CLI needs to ensure its entries are present
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL append any missing entries without removing existing content

#### Scenario: .gitignore entries are idempotent

- **WHEN** `.taskless/.gitignore` already contains `.env.local.json` and `sgconfig.yml`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL NOT duplicate the entries

### Requirement: CLI infers repositoryUrl from git remote

The CLI SHALL infer the repository URL by running `git remote get-url origin` and canonicalizing the result to `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}` format. Both SSH (`git@github.com:owner/repo.git`) and HTTPS (`https://github.com/owner/repo.git`) URLs SHALL be supported.

#### Scenario: HTTPS remote URL is canonicalized

- **WHEN** `git remote get-url origin` returns `https://github.com/acme/widgets.git`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL resolve `repositoryUrl` as `https://github.com/acme/widgets`

#### Scenario: SSH remote URL is canonicalized

- **WHEN** `git remote get-url origin` returns `git@github.com:acme/widgets.git`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL resolve `repositoryUrl` as `https://github.com/acme/widgets`

#### Scenario: No origin remote

- **WHEN** `git remote get-url origin` fails (no remote named `origin`)
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL print an error: "Could not determine repository URL from git remote. Ensure your repository has an 'origin' remote pointing to GitHub."
- **AND** the CLI SHALL exit with a non-zero exit code

#### Scenario: Non-GitHub remote URL

- **WHEN** `git remote get-url origin` returns a URL that is not a GitHub URL
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL print an error indicating only GitHub repositories are supported
- **AND** the CLI SHALL exit with a non-zero exit code

### Requirement: CLI resolves orgId from JWT

The CLI SHALL extract the `orgId` claim from the stored JWT by decoding it with `jose`'s `decodeJwt()` function. No signature verification SHALL be performed. If the JWT does not contain an `orgId` claim, the token is stale and the CLI SHALL prompt the user to re-authenticate.

#### Scenario: JWT contains orgId claim

- **WHEN** the stored JWT contains an `orgId` claim
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL use the JWT's `orgId` value

#### Scenario: JWT lacks orgId claim (stale token)

- **WHEN** the stored JWT does not contain an `orgId` claim
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL print an error: "Your auth token is missing organization info. Run `taskless auth login` to re-authenticate."
- **AND** the CLI SHALL exit with a non-zero exit code

### Requirement: CLI identity resolution function

The CLI SHALL provide a `resolveIdentity(cwd: string)` function that returns `{ orgId: number, repositoryUrl: string }`. This function combines JWT-based `orgId` resolution with git remote-based `repositoryUrl` inference. All commands that previously read identity from `taskless.json` SHALL use this function instead.

#### Scenario: Full identity resolved from JWT and git remote

- **WHEN** the JWT contains an `orgId` claim and `git remote get-url origin` returns a valid GitHub URL
- **THEN** `resolveIdentity()` SHALL return both `orgId` and `repositoryUrl`

#### Scenario: Auth token not available

- **WHEN** no token is available (no env var, no `.env.local.json`, no global auth file)
- **THEN** `resolveIdentity()` SHALL throw an error indicating authentication is required

### Requirement: CLI info subcommand outputs version as JSON

The CLI SHALL support a `taskless info` subcommand that outputs a JSON object to stdout. The object SHALL contain the CLI `version`, a `tools` array, and a `loggedIn` boolean. The `loggedIn` field SHALL be `true` when a token is available (via `TASKLESS_TOKEN` env var or token file) and `false` otherwise. Each entry in `tools` SHALL include the tool name, a list of installed skills with their versions, and whether each skill is current or outdated compared to the CLI's bundled version. When no tool directories are detected, the `tools` array SHALL be empty.

#### Scenario: Running taskless info outputs version, tool status, and login status

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless info` in a repository with Claude Code installed and taskless skills present
- **THEN** stdout SHALL contain a JSON object with `version` (string), `tools` (array), and `loggedIn` (boolean)
- **AND** the `tools` array SHALL include an entry for Claude Code with installed skill versions and staleness status

#### Scenario: Info output is valid JSON

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless info`
- **THEN** the stdout output SHALL be parseable by `JSON.parse()`
- **AND** the resulting object SHALL have a `version` property of type string, a `tools` property of type array, and a `loggedIn` property of type boolean

#### Scenario: Info with no tools detected

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless info` in a directory with no tool directories
- **THEN** the `tools` array in the output SHALL be empty

#### Scenario: Info reports outdated skills

- **WHEN** an installed skill has a `metadata.version` that differs from the CLI's bundled version
- **THEN** the tool entry SHALL indicate the skill is outdated with both the installed and current versions

#### Scenario: Info reports logged in when token exists

- **WHEN** a token is available via `TASKLESS_TOKEN` env var or token file
- **THEN** `loggedIn` SHALL be `true`

#### Scenario: Info reports not logged in when no token

- **WHEN** no token is available
- **THEN** `loggedIn` SHALL be `false`

### Requirement: CLI version is injected at build time

The CLI's `vite.config.ts` SHALL use the Vite `define` option to replace a `__VERSION__` sentinel with the version string read from `packages/cli/package.json` at build time. No runtime file reads or import assertions SHALL be used for version resolution.

#### Scenario: Build replaces version sentinel

- **WHEN** `pnpm build` is run in `packages/cli/`
- **THEN** all occurrences of `__VERSION__` in source code SHALL be replaced with the literal version string from package.json

### Requirement: citty is the argument parser

The CLI SHALL use `citty` as its sole argument parsing dependency. Each subcommand SHALL be defined as an isolated command object and registered with the main CLI via `defineCommand` and `runMain`.

#### Scenario: citty is declared as a dependency

- **WHEN** inspecting `packages/cli/package.json`
- **THEN** `citty` SHALL be listed in `dependencies`
