# CLI

## Purpose

TBD — Defines the structure and build requirements for the `@taskless/cli` package.

## Requirements

### Requirement: CLI package exists at packages/cli

The `@taskless/cli` package SHALL exist at `packages/cli/` with its own `package.json` declaring the package name `@taskless/cli`.

#### Scenario: Package is discoverable by pnpm workspace

- **WHEN** `pnpm-workspace.yaml` declares `packages/*`
- **THEN** pnpm SHALL resolve `@taskless/cli` as a workspace package at `packages/cli/`

### Requirement: CLI has a bin entry point

The package SHALL declare a `bin` field in `package.json` pointing to the built output. The built file SHALL include a Node.js shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env node`).

#### Scenario: CLI is executable via npx

- **WHEN** a user runs `npx @taskless/cli`
- **THEN** Node.js SHALL execute the bin entry point

#### Scenario: CLI is executable via pnpm dlx

- **WHEN** a user runs `pnpm dlx @taskless/cli`
- **THEN** Node.js SHALL execute the bin entry point

### Requirement: CLI builds with Vite

The CLI SHALL use Vite in library mode to produce a single bundled ESM output file. The build configuration SHALL live in `packages/cli/vite.config.ts`.

#### Scenario: Build produces executable output

- **WHEN** `pnpm build` is run in `packages/cli/`
- **THEN** Vite SHALL produce a single file in `dist/` that is a valid Node.js ESM module with a shebang

### Requirement: CLI TypeScript config extends base

The CLI SHALL have a `packages/cli/tsconfig.json` that extends `../../tsconfig.base.json`. It SHALL add any CLI-specific compiler options without duplicating base settings.

#### Scenario: Type checking passes independently

- **WHEN** `pnpm typecheck` is run in `packages/cli/`
- **THEN** `tsc` SHALL pass with no errors using the extended config

### Requirement: CLI stub entry point

The initial CLI entry point SHALL be a minimal stub that outputs a message confirming the CLI is running. No additional functionality is required at this stage.

#### Scenario: Running the CLI produces output

- **WHEN** the CLI is executed
- **THEN** it SHALL print a message to stdout confirming the Taskless CLI is running
