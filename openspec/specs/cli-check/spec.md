# CLI Check

## Purpose

TBD — Defines the `taskless check` subcommand that validates project setup and runs ast-grep scanning to detect rule violations.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Check subcommand works without taskless.json

The `check` command SHALL NOT require `.taskless/taskless.json` to exist. The command SHALL only require the presence of rule files in `.taskless/rules/`.

#### Scenario: Check succeeds without taskless.json

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless check` in a directory with `.taskless/rules/*.yml` files but no `taskless.json`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL proceed to generate `sgconfig.yml` and run the scanner

#### Scenario: Check exits cleanly with no .taskless/ directory

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless check` in a directory without a `.taskless/` directory
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL print a message: "No rules configured. Create one with `taskless rule create`."
- **AND** the CLI SHALL exit with code 0

#### Scenario: Check exits cleanly with empty rules directory

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless check` and `.taskless/rules/` contains no `.yml` files
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL print a warning that no rules were found
- **AND** the CLI SHALL exit with code 0

### Requirement: Check subcommand generates ephemeral sgconfig.yml

The `check` command SHALL generate an `sgconfig.yml` file in `.taskless/` before invoking ast-grep. The generated config SHALL set `ruleDirs` to `['rules']` and `testConfigs` to `[{testDir: 'rule-tests'}]`. The file SHALL be written to `.taskless/sgconfig.yml` which is gitignored via `.taskless/.gitignore`. If `.taskless/.gitignore` does not exist, the CLI SHALL create it before writing the config.

#### Scenario: sgconfig.yml is generated at check time

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless check`
- **AND** `.taskless/rules/` contains rule files
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL write `.taskless/sgconfig.yml` with `ruleDirs: ['rules']`
- **AND** the CLI SHALL pass `--config .taskless/sgconfig.yml` to ast-grep

#### Scenario: Existing sgconfig.yml is overwritten

- **WHEN** `.taskless/sgconfig.yml` already exists (from a previous run or legacy scaffold)
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL overwrite it with the freshly generated content

### Requirement: Check subcommand warns when no rules exist

The CLI SHALL check for the presence of YAML rule files in the `.taskless/rules/` directory. When no rule files are found, the CLI SHALL warn the user and exit cleanly.

#### Scenario: No rule files in rules directory

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless check` and `.taskless/rules/` contains no `.yml` files
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL print a warning message indicating no rules were found
- **AND** the CLI SHALL exit with code 0

#### Scenario: Rules directory contains rule files

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless check` and `.taskless/rules/` contains one or more `.yml` files
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL proceed to run the scanner

### Requirement: Check subcommand executes ast-grep scan

The CLI SHALL generate an ephemeral `sgconfig.yml` in `.taskless/` and execute
`sg scan --config .taskless/sgconfig.yml --json=stream` using `child_process.spawn` with
`shell: true` for cross-platform binary resolution. The `sg` binary SHALL be resolved from
the `@ast-grep/cli` dependency via PATH. When reconciliation succeeds, the scan SHALL cover
only the blessed `run`-set rule files; on the unauthenticated/`--anonymous` path, or when an
authenticated reconciliation degrades to a local scan, the scan SHALL cover all local rule
files as before.

#### Scenario: ast-grep scan runs with generated config

- **WHEN** the CLI executes the scanner
- **THEN** it SHALL first write `.taskless/sgconfig.yml`
- **AND** it SHALL invoke `sg scan` with `--config .taskless/sgconfig.yml` and `--json=stream`
- **AND** the working directory for the spawned process SHALL be the resolved project directory

#### Scenario: Scan is limited to the run set when reconciled

- **WHEN** reconciliation succeeded and returned a `run` set
- **THEN** the generated scan configuration SHALL cause `sg scan` to evaluate only the
  `run`-set rule files

#### Scenario: ast-grep binary is not found

- **WHEN** the `sg` binary cannot be resolved from PATH
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL print an error message indicating ast-grep is not available
- **AND** the CLI SHALL exit with code 1

### Requirement: Check subcommand maps ast-grep output to CheckResult

The CLI SHALL parse the JSONL stream from `sg scan --json=stream` and map each match object to an internal `CheckResult` type. The `CheckResult` type SHALL include: `source` (string), `ruleId` (string), `severity` ("error" | "warning" | "info" | "hint"), `message` (string), `note` (optional string), `file` (string), `range` (start/end with line and column), `matchedText` (string), and `fix` (optional string).

#### Scenario: ast-grep match is mapped to CheckResult

- **WHEN** ast-grep outputs a JSON match object with `ruleId`, `severity`, `message`, `text`, `file`, and `range`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL produce a `CheckResult` with `source` set to `"ast-grep"` and all other fields mapped from the match object

#### Scenario: ast-grep match with note and fix

- **WHEN** ast-grep outputs a match with `note` and `replacement` fields
- **THEN** the `CheckResult` SHALL include the `note` and `fix` values

### Requirement: Check subcommand formats human-readable output by default

When the `--json` flag is not set, the CLI SHALL format `CheckResult` items as human-readable diagnostic output to stdout. Each result SHALL display the file path with line and column, severity and rule ID, message, matched source text, and optional note.

#### Scenario: Human output for a single error

- **WHEN** the scanner produces one error-severity result in `src/utils.ts` at line 42 column 5
- **THEN** stdout SHALL include the file location, severity tag, rule ID, message, and matched text in a readable format

#### Scenario: Human output summary

- **WHEN** the scanner completes with results
- **THEN** stdout SHALL include a summary line with the count of issues by severity and the number of files scanned

#### Scenario: Human output with no issues found

- **WHEN** the scanner completes with zero results
- **THEN** stdout SHALL indicate that no issues were found

### Requirement: Check subcommand formats JSON output when --json is set

When the `--json` flag is set, the CLI SHALL output each `CheckResult` as a JSON object per line (JSONL format) to stdout.

#### Scenario: JSON output streams results

- **WHEN** the `--json` flag is set and the scanner produces results
- **THEN** each `CheckResult` SHALL be written as a single-line JSON object to stdout, one per line

#### Scenario: JSON output with no issues

- **WHEN** the `--json` flag is set and the scanner produces zero results
- **THEN** stdout SHALL contain no output lines

### Requirement: Check subcommand exit codes reflect error severity

The CLI SHALL exit with code 0 when no error-severity matches are found (including when only warnings, info, or hints exist). The CLI SHALL exit with code 1 when at least one error-severity match is found.

#### Scenario: Exit 0 when clean

- **WHEN** the scanner produces zero results
- **THEN** the process SHALL exit with code 0

#### Scenario: Exit 0 when only warnings

- **WHEN** the scanner produces results but none have severity "error"
- **THEN** the process SHALL exit with code 0

#### Scenario: Exit 1 when errors found

- **WHEN** the scanner produces at least one result with severity "error"
- **THEN** the process SHALL exit with code 1

### Requirement: Check subcommand respects global working directory flag

The `check` subcommand SHALL use the resolved working directory from the global `-d` flag (or `process.cwd()` if not specified) as the target directory for `.taskless/` validation and scanner execution.

#### Scenario: Check uses custom directory

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless check -d /path/to/repo`
- **THEN** `.taskless/` validation and scanning SHALL operate on `/path/to/repo`

#### Scenario: Check defaults to current directory

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless check` without `-d`
- **THEN** `.taskless/` validation and scanning SHALL operate on `process.cwd()`

### Requirement: Check accepts positional path arguments

The `check` subcommand SHALL accept zero or more positional path arguments. When zero paths are passed, the CLI SHALL scan the full project directory (existing behavior). When one or more paths are passed, the CLI SHALL forward those paths to `sg scan` so that only the specified files and directories are scanned. Paths SHALL be treated relative to the resolved working directory (`-d` / `process.cwd()`).

Before forwarding, the CLI SHALL silently drop any path that does not exist on disk at invocation time. This lets CI pipelines pipe raw git-diff output directly (e.g. `taskless check $(git diff --name-only main...HEAD)`) without pre-filtering deleted files. If every supplied path is filtered out and the original argument list was non-empty, the CLI SHALL exit with code 0 and print no matches (interpreted as "nothing changed, nothing to scan").

#### Scenario: Zero path arguments scans the whole project

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless check`
- **THEN** `sg scan` SHALL be invoked without any trailing path arguments
- **AND** the scan SHALL cover the entire resolved working directory

#### Scenario: Explicit paths limit the scan

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless check src/foo.ts src/bar.ts`
- **AND** both files exist on disk
- **THEN** `sg scan` SHALL be invoked with `src/foo.ts` and `src/bar.ts` as trailing arguments
- **AND** the scan SHALL NOT include files outside those two paths

#### Scenario: Non-existent paths are silently filtered

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless check src/present.ts src/deleted.ts`
- **AND** `src/present.ts` exists but `src/deleted.ts` does not
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL forward only `src/present.ts` to `sg scan`
- **AND** SHALL NOT error on the missing path

#### Scenario: All paths filtered out exits cleanly

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless check src/deleted-a.ts src/deleted-b.ts`
- **AND** neither file exists on disk
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL exit with code 0
- **AND** SHALL NOT invoke `sg scan`
- **AND** SHALL report no results (empty results array in JSON mode)

#### Scenario: Relative paths resolve against the working directory

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless check -d /path/to/project src/foo.ts`
- **AND** `/path/to/project/src/foo.ts` exists
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL treat `src/foo.ts` as relative to `/path/to/project`
- **AND** SHALL forward that relative path to `sg scan` with `cwd = /path/to/project`

#### Scenario: Directory paths are accepted

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless check src/`
- **AND** `src/` is a directory
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL forward `src/` to `sg scan`
- **AND** the scan SHALL cover files under that directory

### Requirement: Check accepts --anonymous as a no-op

The `taskless check` command SHALL accept the global `--anonymous` flag (per the `cli`
capability). Because `check` reconciles against the Taskless API when authenticated,
`--anonymous` SHALL force the logged-out path: it SHALL suppress the reconcile network call
and run all local rule files. Aside from forcing the logged-out path, `--anonymous` SHALL NOT
change scan behavior, output shape, or exit codes relative to an unauthenticated `check`.

#### Scenario: check --anonymous skips reconciliation

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless check --anonymous`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL NOT call `POST /cli/api/reconcile`
- **AND** SHALL scan all local rule files

#### Scenario: check --anonymous matches an unauthenticated check

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless check --anonymous`
- **THEN** its scan behavior, output, and exit code SHALL match `taskless check` run with no
  available token

### Requirement: Check error output uses standardized error envelope

When `taskless check --json` exits with an error, the output SHALL conform to the standardized error envelope `{ "ok": false, "code": "<CODE>", "message": "<...>" }` per the `cli` capability requirements. Existing success-shape requirements for `--json` are unchanged.

#### Scenario: check --json error uses standardized envelope

- **WHEN** `taskless check --json` fails (e.g. ast-grep invocation error)
- **THEN** stdout SHALL contain a JSON object matching the standardized error envelope
- **AND** SHALL include a stable `code` field (e.g. `SCAN_FAILED` if added to the enum)

### Requirement: Check selects what it runs from auth state

`taskless check` SHALL NOT require authentication, and it SHALL choose what it runs from the
current auth state. **Static ast-grep rules** (single `*.yml` files under `.taskless/rules/`)
SHALL always run without contacting the server, on every path (the offline linter posture).
**Runtime rules** (directories with `metadata.taskless.kind: runtime`) SHALL run only on a
signature-validated path: when a token is available and `--anonymous` is not set the CLI SHALL
reconcile and execute the runtime rules fully returned in `run`; when no token is available,
when `--anonymous` is set, or when reconciliation cannot complete, the CLI SHALL skip runtime
execution unless `--dangerously-run-scripts` is set. The unauthenticated path SHALL succeed
with no network access for static rules and SHALL NOT emit a warning about missing
authentication.

#### Scenario: Unauthenticated check runs static rules and skips runtime rules

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless check` with no available token
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL scan all static rule files
- **AND** SHALL NOT call `POST /cli/api/reconcile` for the purpose of running static rules
- **AND** SHALL skip runtime rules
- **AND** SHALL NOT emit a warning about missing authentication

#### Scenario: Authenticated check reconciles runtime rules

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless check` with an available token and without `--anonymous`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL reconcile and execute the runtime rules fully returned in `run`
- **AND** SHALL run static rules unconditionally

#### Scenario: Anonymous forces the logged-out path

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless check --anonymous` while a token is available
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL behave exactly as an unauthenticated `check` (static rules run, runtime rules skipped, no reconcile call)

### Requirement: Check reconciles rule files before scanning

`taskless check` SHALL reconcile before running runtime rules whenever a bearer token and a
`repositoryUrl` are resolvable and `--anonymous` is not set. It SHALL compute the signature
envelope for the `check.ts` of every runtime rule under `.taskless/runtime-rules/`, call
`POST /cli/api/reconcile` with `{ repositoryUrl, files }`, and then execute **only** the
runtime rules whose `check.ts` is returned in the `run` set, matched back to local files by
signature (per the `cli-rule-reconciliation` capability). Capture `*.yml` and static rules
SHALL NOT be gated by reconciliation.

#### Scenario: Only rules with a blessed check.ts execute

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless check` while authenticated and reconciliation returns a `run`
  set covering the `check.ts` of some runtime rules and not others
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL execute only the runtime rules whose `check.ts` is in `run`
- **AND** SHALL run all static rules regardless of the `run` set

### Requirement: Check degrades to a local scan when reconciliation cannot complete

`taskless check` SHALL NOT fail solely because an attempted reconciliation cannot complete.
When a token is available and `--anonymous` is not set but reconciliation cannot complete (no
resolvable git remote, or the reconcile endpoint is unreachable or not yet deployed, or a
transport error), the CLI SHALL warn that rule verification could not be performed, SHALL fall
back to scanning all **static** rule files, and SHALL **skip runtime rules** (their `check.ts`
SHALL NOT run) unless `--dangerously-run-scripts` is set. The CLI SHALL NOT exit with a
non-zero code solely because reconciliation failed, and the warning SHALL be suppressed under
`--json`.

#### Scenario: Endpoint unreachable degrades static and skips runtime

- **WHEN** an authenticated `check` attempts reconciliation and the endpoint is unreachable or returns a not-deployed error
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL warn that verification could not be performed
- **AND** SHALL scan all static rule files
- **AND** SHALL NOT execute any runtime rule's `check.ts`
- **AND** SHALL NOT exit with a non-zero code solely due to the reconcile failure

#### Scenario: Degrade warning is suppressed under --json

- **WHEN** the CLI degrades and `--json` is set
- **THEN** stdout SHALL contain the machine JSON shape (`{ success, results }` plus the additive optional `skipped` array for the skipped runtime rules)
- **AND** SHALL NOT contain the human-readable degrade warning

### Requirement: Check dispatches static and runtime rules to distinct executors

`taskless check` SHALL execute **static** ast-grep rules under `.taskless/rules/` with the
ast-grep scanner as before, and **runtime** rules under `.taskless/runtime-rules/` (directories
with `metadata.taskless.kind: runtime`, per the `cli-runtime-rule-execution` capability) with
the runtime harness. Findings from both executors SHALL be aggregated into the same result set
and SHALL count toward the exit code identically.

#### Scenario: Mixed corpus runs both executors

- **WHEN** `.taskless/rules/` contains static rules and `.taskless/runtime-rules/` contains runtime rules
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL run static rules through `sg scan` and runtime rules through the runtime harness
- **AND** SHALL merge their findings into one result set

### Requirement: Check runs runtime rules only on a signature-validated path

`taskless check` SHALL execute a runtime rule's `check.ts` only when that `check.ts` has been
validated by the server — returned in the reconciliation `run` set — or when
`--dangerously-run-scripts` is set. When a token is available and `--anonymous` is not set, the
CLI SHALL reconcile and execute every runtime rule whose `check.ts` is in `run`. An API key
SHALL be treated identically to an interactive token. On any path where the runtime rule's
`check.ts` signature is not validated — logged out, `--anonymous`, or a reconciliation that
cannot complete — the CLI SHALL NOT execute the rule's `check.ts`.

#### Scenario: Authenticated check runs blessed runtime rules

- **WHEN** an authenticated `check` reconciles and a runtime rule's `check.ts` is returned in `run`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL execute that runtime rule through the harness

#### Scenario: A rule whose check.ts is not blessed is withheld

- **WHEN** reconciliation does not return a runtime rule's `check.ts` in `run` (it lands in `unsafe`/`unknown`/`missing`)
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL NOT execute that runtime rule
- **AND** SHALL surface it as an advisory mismatch

#### Scenario: API key behaves like a token

- **WHEN** `check` runs with an API key
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL reconcile and run validated runtime rules exactly as with an interactive token

### Requirement: Check skips runtime rules on unverified paths and reports the skip

`taskless check` SHALL skip a runtime rule's execution when it cannot validate the rule's
signature — logged out, `--anonymous`, or reconciliation cannot complete — and
`--dangerously-run-scripts` is not set. It SHALL report that runtime rules exist and were not
run, SHALL still run static rules on these paths, and SHALL NOT change the exit code because
rules were skipped. In human output the report SHALL be a notice; under `--json` it SHALL be an
additive, optional `skipped` array of `{ rule, reason }`, leaving the existing `success` and
`results` fields unchanged, so machine callers (for example CI) can detect that runtime rules
did not run.

#### Scenario: Logged-out check skips runtime rules

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless check` with no available token and runtime rules are present
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL run static rules
- **AND** SHALL NOT execute any runtime rule's `check.ts`
- **AND** SHALL report that the runtime rules were skipped
- **AND** SHALL NOT change the exit code because rules were skipped

#### Scenario: Skipped runtime rules appear under --json

- **WHEN** runtime rules are skipped and `--json` is set
- **THEN** stdout SHALL include a `skipped` array of `{ rule, reason }` alongside the unchanged `success` and `results` fields

#### Scenario: Anonymous skips runtime rules while authenticated

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless check --anonymous` while a token is available
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL skip runtime rules exactly as an unauthenticated `check`

### Requirement: Check accepts --dangerously-run-scripts to run runtime rules without server validation

`taskless check` SHALL accept a `--dangerously-run-scripts` flag that runs **all** runtime
rules without server validation, regardless of auth state.
When the flag is set the CLI SHALL NOT reconcile — it SHALL skip the network entirely (matching
how `--anonymous` forces the no-network path) and execute every present runtime rule. The CLI
SHALL emit a prominent warning that runtime rule code is being executed unverified. The flag
SHALL be the only way to execute runtime rules on an unverified path.

#### Scenario: Dangerously-run-scripts executes runtime rules offline

- **WHEN** a user runs `taskless check --dangerously-run-scripts` with no available token
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL execute the present runtime rules' `check.ts`
- **AND** SHALL emit a warning that runtime rule code ran unverified

#### Scenario: Warning is suppressed under --json

- **WHEN** `--dangerously-run-scripts` and `--json` are both set
- **THEN** stdout SHALL contain only the existing `{ success, results }` JSON shape
- **AND** the unverified-execution warning SHALL NOT appear in stdout
