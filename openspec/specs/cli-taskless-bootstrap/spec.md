# CLI Taskless Bootstrap

## Purpose

Defines the migration-based `.taskless/` directory management system, including the filesystem utilities, migration runner, and initial migration.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Migration-based .taskless directory management

The CLI SHALL provide an `ensureTasklessDirectory(cwd)` function in `filesystem/directory.ts` that creates the `.taskless/` directory and delegates to `runMigrations()` in `filesystem/migrate.ts`. Migrations SHALL be defined as a `Record<string, Migration>` where each migration is an idempotent async function with signature `(directory: string) => Promise<void>`.

#### Scenario: First run bootstraps directory via migrations

- **WHEN** an action calls `ensureTasklessDirectory()` and `.taskless/` does not exist
- **THEN** it SHALL create `.taskless/taskless.json` with `{ "version": 0 }`
- **AND** run all registered migrations in order
- **AND** update `taskless.json` version to the max migration key

#### Scenario: Up-to-date directory is a no-op

- **WHEN** `ensureTasklessDirectory()` is called and `taskless.json` version equals the max migration key
- **THEN** it SHALL return immediately without running any migrations

#### Scenario: Outdated directory runs only new migrations

- **WHEN** `taskless.json` has `{ "version": 1 }` and migrations `"1"`, `"2"`, `"3"` are registered
- **THEN** `ensureTasklessDirectory()` SHALL run migrations 2 and 3 (skipping migration 1)
- **AND** update `taskless.json` version to 3

#### Scenario: Non-numeric version is treated as 0

- **WHEN** `taskless.json` has a non-numeric version (e.g., `"2026-03-02"` from v0 scaffold)
- **THEN** the migration runner SHALL treat it as version 0 and run all migrations

#### Scenario: Each migration is idempotent

- **WHEN** a migration runs against a directory where its changes already exist
- **THEN** it SHALL complete without errors and without duplicating files or content

### Requirement: Migrations are keyed numerically and sorted at runtime

Migrations SHALL be stored as a `Record<string, Migration>` with numeric string keys (e.g., `"1"`, `"2"`, `"3"`). Keys are cast to `Number` and sorted numerically at runtime via `toSorted()`. Older migrations MAY be removed once the minimum supported version advances.

#### Scenario: Migrations are sorted numerically

- **WHEN** the migration runner processes the registry
- **THEN** migrations SHALL be sorted by their numeric key value, not by insertion order

### Requirement: First migration creates initial directory structure

The first migration (`"1"` in `filesystem/migrations/0001-init.ts`) SHALL create the initial `.taskless/` directory structure: `README.md` with usage documentation (always overwritten), `.gitignore` entries via `addToGitignore(cwd, [".env.local.json", "sgconfig.yml"])`, `rules/` directory, and `rule-tests/` directory.

#### Scenario: README content

- **WHEN** migration `"1"` runs
- **THEN** `.taskless/README.md` SHALL be written (overwriting any existing content) with a link to taskless.io, usage examples showing `pnpm dlx` and `npx` invocations of `@taskless/cli@latest check`, and a file listing describing `taskless.json`, `.env.local.json`, `rules/`, and `rule-tests/`

#### Scenario: Gitignore is created

- **WHEN** migration `"1"` runs
- **THEN** `.taskless/.gitignore` SHALL contain entries for `.env.local.json` and `sgconfig.yml`

#### Scenario: Subdirectories are created

- **WHEN** migration `"1"` runs
- **THEN** `.taskless/rules/` and `.taskless/rule-tests/` SHALL exist

### Requirement: Filesystem utilities are generic

The `filesystem/` module SHALL provide generic utilities that migrations compose:

- `addToGitignore(cwd, globs)`: Idempotently adds glob patterns to `.taskless/.gitignore`
- `generateSgConfig(cwd)`: Writes ephemeral `sgconfig.yml` with `ruleDirs` and `testConfigs`

These utilities SHALL NOT hardcode Taskless-specific entries — the migrations decide what to pass.

#### Scenario: addToGitignore is idempotent

- **WHEN** `addToGitignore(cwd, [".env.local.json"])` is called twice
- **THEN** `.env.local.json` SHALL appear exactly once in `.taskless/.gitignore`

### Requirement: Bootstrap is called from all write paths

The `ensureTasklessDirectory()` function SHALL be called from: `writeRuleFile()`, `writeRuleTestFile()`, `generateSgConfig()`, and the `rule verify` command. This ensures `.taskless/` is always properly initialized and up-to-date before any file writes.

#### Scenario: Rule file write triggers bootstrap

- **WHEN** `writeRuleFile()` is called and `.taskless/` does not exist
- **THEN** `ensureTasklessDirectory()` SHALL run before writing the rule file

#### Scenario: Verify command triggers bootstrap

- **WHEN** `taskless rule verify` runs and needs to generate `sgconfig.yml`
- **THEN** `ensureTasklessDirectory()` SHALL run as part of the `generateSgConfig()` call

### Requirement: Migration 2 initializes an empty install object

Migration `"2"` SHALL be registered in the migration runner. Its behavior is idempotent: if `taskless.json` does not yet contain an `install` field, migration 2 SHALL add `install: {}` as a top-level object. If the field is already present, migration 2 SHALL leave it untouched. After migration 2 runs, `taskless.json` version SHALL be updated to `2` by the migration runner's existing finalization logic.

#### Scenario: Fresh project has install object after bootstrap

- **WHEN** `ensureTasklessDirectory()` is called in a project without a prior `.taskless/` directory
- **THEN** `taskless.json` SHALL be created with `{ "version": 2, "install": {} }`

#### Scenario: Existing v1 project is forward-migrated

- **WHEN** `ensureTasklessDirectory()` is called in a project whose existing `taskless.json` is at version `1`
- **THEN** the migration runner SHALL invoke migration 2
- **AND** `taskless.json` SHALL contain `install: {}`
- **AND** `taskless.json` version SHALL be `2`

#### Scenario: Migration 2 preserves existing install object

- **WHEN** `ensureTasklessDirectory()` is called in a project whose `taskless.json` already contains an `install` object (e.g., from a prior run of migration 2 that partially completed)
- **THEN** migration 2 SHALL NOT overwrite the existing `install` object

### Requirement: Install manifest schema is a recognized top-level field

The `TasklessManifest` type in `packages/cli/src/filesystem/migrate.ts` SHALL be extended to include an optional `install` field with the following shape:

```ts
interface TasklessManifest {
  version: number;
  install?: {
    installedAt?: string;
    cliVersion?: string;
    targets?: Record<
      string,
      {
        skills?: string[];
        commands?: string[];
      }
    >;
    onboarded?: boolean;
  };
}
```

The `install.onboarded` field is optional and three-state: absent (never explicitly onboarded), `false` (explicitly reset), or `true` (user confirmed onboarding is complete). The `taskless init` install path SHALL NOT set this field. The field SHALL only be written by the `taskless onboard --mark-complete` subcommand, which is invoked by the host agent only after explicit user confirmation. Reads of `taskless.json` SHALL preserve unknown fields on round-trip writes so the manifest remains forward-compatible with future migrations.

#### Scenario: Install field round-trips through read/write

- **WHEN** `taskless.json` contains an `install` object
- **AND** the CLI reads the manifest and writes it back
- **THEN** the `install` object SHALL be preserved verbatim

#### Scenario: Unknown fields are preserved on write

- **WHEN** `taskless.json` contains an unknown top-level field (e.g., `experimental: {...}`)
- **AND** the CLI writes the manifest after a version bump
- **THEN** the unknown field SHALL still be present in the output

#### Scenario: Onboarded field round-trips through read/write

- **WHEN** `taskless.json` contains `install.onboarded: true`
- **AND** the CLI reads the manifest and writes it back (e.g., as part of a re-install)
- **THEN** the `install.onboarded: true` value SHALL be preserved

#### Scenario: Init does not set onboarded

- **WHEN** `taskless init` runs against a project with no prior `install.onboarded` value
- **THEN** the resulting `taskless.json` SHALL NOT contain an `install.onboarded` field

### Requirement: Onboarded field semantics are 3-state and consent-gated

The optional `install.onboarded` boolean field on the install manifest SHALL be interpreted by all readers as three meaningful states:

| Value   | Meaning                                                               |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| absent  | Never explicitly onboarded (the post-install default)                 |
| `false` | Explicitly reset (treated equivalently to absent for gating purposes) |
| `true`  | User confirmed onboarding is complete                                 |

The field SHALL only be written by the `taskless onboard --mark-complete` subcommand. No other CLI code path (including `taskless init`, the wizard, and any future migration) SHALL write or set this field automatically. The field MAY be edited manually by an advanced user; such edits are out of scope for the CLI's guarantees.

#### Scenario: Absent and false both gate as "not onboarded"

- **WHEN** any consumer of the manifest reads `install.onboarded`
- **AND** the field is absent OR `false`
- **THEN** the consumer SHALL treat the user as not yet onboarded for any gating purpose

#### Scenario: True gates as "onboarded"

- **WHEN** any consumer of the manifest reads `install.onboarded`
- **AND** the field is `true`
- **THEN** the consumer SHALL treat the user as onboarded

#### Scenario: No CLI path writes onboarded except mark-complete

- **WHEN** the codebase is searched for writes to `install.onboarded`
- **THEN** the only producer SHALL be the `taskless onboard --mark-complete` subcommand
