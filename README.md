# Taskless Skills

A skills repository for agentic workflows, built for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and other Agent capable systems.

Includes a CLI that works with agentic systems (and humans too) at @taskless/cli.

```

## Skill

Starting in v0.7, Taskless ships a **single consolidated skill** (`taskless`) plus a single `/tskl` slash command. The skill body is a small router; per-task instructions live behind `npx @taskless/cli help <topic>` and are fetched on demand.

| Skill      | Command       | Description                                            |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `taskless` | `/tskl <ask>` | Router for any Taskless action (create rule, improve,  |
|            |               | delete, check, auth, CI). Fetches the canonical recipe |
|            |               | for the user's intent and follows it.                  |

Available `taskless help` topics: `rule create`, `rule improve`, `rule delete`, `check`, `auth`, `ci`, `info`, `init`, `update`. Append `--anonymous` for the local-only flow on rule create/improve.

## CLI

The `@taskless/cli` package provides a CLI agent for Taskless workflows. It's recommended to always call the `latest` tag unless you know you need a specific version:

```bash
pnpm dlx @taskless/cli@latest info
npx @taskless/cli@latest info
```

## Local development

The CLI bakes its own invocation string into the skill, command, and recipe
content it installs. Three build targets pick that string, all driven by the
`TASKLESS_BUILD_TARGET` env var via Vite `define` (same source files, no edits):

Each target also emits to its own directory so the three never overwrite one
another — prod → `dist/`, dev → `dist-dev/`, self → `dist-self/` (all
gitignored):

| Command           | Output dir   | Baked invocation                            | Use for                                                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pnpm build`      | `dist/`      | `npx @taskless/cli`                         | Production / published builds (default).                                             |
| `pnpm build:dev`  | `dist-dev/`  | `node <abs>/packages/cli/dist-dev/index.js` | Validating this build from **another** repo (absolute path resolves anywhere).       |
| `pnpm build:self` | `dist-self/` | `node packages/cli/dist-self/index.js`      | Dogfooding **in this repo** (path is repo-root-relative; run the CLI from the root). |

`pnpm build:self` builds the CLI with the relative invocation and then runs
`taskless init --no-interactive` to install into this repo — so `.claude` gets
real reference stubs that delegate to the canonical `.taskless/` content, exactly
like any other install. (This replaces the former raw-symlink `link-skills`
step, so local dogfooding always matches a true install.)

> The `dev`/`self` invocations are local paths and must never be published —
> only `pnpm build` (or `pnpm package`) produces a release artifact.

## Releasing taskless/skills

Releases use [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) with Turborepo for orchestration.

### Release process

Start from a clean repo (no uncommitted changes), then:

```bash
pnpm bump               # Bump versions and sync skill metadata
pnpm build              # Build CLI and generate commands
pnpm test               # Run all tests, confirm no errors
git add -A              # Stage all changes
git commit -m "chore: Releases vx.y.z"  # Commit with new version number
pnpm release            # Dry run — prints publish command when ready
```

### Adding a new topic recipe

In v0.7+, new agent-facing instructions are added as **recipes**, not skills. To add a recipe:

1. Create `packages/cli/src/help/<topic>.txt` following the canonical template (Goal / Preconditions / Steps / Input schema / Errors / See Also).
2. Use `{{CLI_VERSION}}` and `{{INPUT_SCHEMA}}` placeholders for runtime interpolation.
3. For topics with a substantively different local-only flow, add `<topic>.anonymous.txt`. The help command's variant lookup is automatic.
4. Update the topic table in `skills/taskless/SKILL.md` and `commands/tskl/tskl.md` so agents can discover the new topic.

### Distribution channels

- **`taskless init`** — CLI installs the consolidated skill to `.claude/skills/taskless/` and the command to `.claude/commands/tskl/`
- **Claude Code Plugin Marketplace** — `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and `plugin.json`
- **Vercel Skills CLI** — `npx skills add` discovers skills from `skills/` directory
